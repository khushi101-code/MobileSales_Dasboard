## Process of Building the Dashboard

I followed a structured end-to-end approach using **Power BI** to build this dashboard:

### Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed duplicates and standardized brand/model names.
* Ensured consistent formatting for dates and numeric fields.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Identified key trends in sales, revenue, and customer satisfaction.
* Analyzed performance by region, month, and brand.

### Step 3: Creating Visualizations in Power BI

* Designed KPIs, maps, line charts, pie charts, and bar graphs for clarity.
* Added slicers for interactivity by month and region.

### Step 4: Dashboard Development

* Combined all visuals into a cohesive, interactive dashboard.
* Applied professional themes and clear labels for usability.
